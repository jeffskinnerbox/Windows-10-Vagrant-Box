# Windows Templates for Packer

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/76pea1oexae5ca05?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/StefanScherer/packer-windows)

### Introduction

This repository contains Windows templates that can be used to create boxes for
Vagrant using Packer ([Website](https://www.packer.io))
([Github](https://github.com/mitchellh/packer)).

This repo is a modified fork of the popular
[joefitzgerald/packer-windows](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/packer-windows)
repo.

Some of my enhancements are:

* Support of fullscreen Retina display on a MacBook Pro.
* WinRM, no more OpenSSH

### Packer Version

[Packer](https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) `1.3.3` is recommended.

### Windows Versions

The following Windows versions are known to work (built with VMware Fusion Pro
11.0.2):

* Windows 10
  * Windows 10 1809 -> Vagrant Cloud box [StefanScherer/windows_10](https://app.vagrantup.com/StefanScherer/boxes/windows_10)
  * Windows 10 Insider
* Windows Server 2016 Desktop -> Vagrant Cloud box [StefanScherer/windows_2016](https://app.vagrantup.com/StefanScherer/boxes/windows_2016)
* Windows Server 2019 Desktop -> Vagrant Cloud box [StefanScherer/windows_2019](https://app.vagrantup.com/StefanScherer/boxes/windows_2019)
* Windows Server Core
  * Windows Server 2016 without and with Docker -> Vagrant Cloud box [StefanScherer/windows_2016_docker](https://app.vagrantup.com/StefanScherer/boxes/windows_2016_docker)
  * Windows Server 2019 without and with Docker -> Vagrant Cloud box [StefanScherer/windows_2019_docker](https://app.vagrantup.com/StefanScherer/boxes/windows_2019_docker)
  * Windows Server 1709, 1803, 1809, 1903, and 1909 all without and with Docker
  * Windows Server InsiderPreview Semi-Annual without and with Docker

You may find other packer template files, but older versions of Windows doesn't
work so nice with a Retina display.

### Windows Editions

All Windows Server versions are defaulted to the Server Standard edition. You
can modify this by editing the Autounattend.xml file, changing the
`ImageInstall`>`OSImage`>`InstallFrom`>`MetaData`>`Value` element (e.g. to
Windows Server 2012 R2 SERVERDATACENTER).

To retrieve the correct ImageName from an ISO file use the following two commands.

```
PS C:\> Mount-DiskImage -ImagePath C:\iso\Windows_InsiderPreview_Server_2_16237.iso
PS C:\> Get-WindowsImage -ImagePath e:\sources\install.wim

ImageIndex       : 1
ImageName        : Windows Server 2016 SERVERSTANDARDACORE
ImageDescription : Windows Server 2016 SERVERSTANDARDACORE
ImageSize        : 7,341,507,794 bytes

ImageIndex       : 2
ImageName        : Windows Server 2016 SERVERDATACENTERACORE
ImageDescription : Windows Server 2016 SERVERDATACENTERACORE
ImageSize        : 7,373,846,520 bytes
```

### Product Keys

The `Autounattend.xml` files are configured to work correctly with trial ISOs
(which will be downloaded and cached for you the first time you perform a
`packer build`). If you would like to use retail or volume license ISOs, you
need to update the `UserData`>`ProductKey` element as follows:

* Uncomment the `<Key>...</Key>` element
* Insert your product key into the `Key` element

If you are going to configure your VM as a KMS client, you can use the product
keys at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj612867.aspx. These are the
default values used in the `Key` element.

### Using existing ISOs

If you have already downloaded the ISOs or would like to override them, set
these additional variables:

* iso_url - path to existing ISO
* iso_checksum - md5sum of existing ISO (if different)

```
packer build -var 'iso_url=./server2016.iso' .\windows_2016.json
```

### Windows Updates

The scripts in this repo will install all Windows updates – by default – during
Windows Setup. This is a _very_ time consuming process, depending on the age of
the OS and the quantity of updates released since the last service pack. You
might want to do yourself a favor during development and disable this
functionality, by commenting out the `WITH WINDOWS UPDATES` section and
uncommenting the `WITHOUT WINDOWS UPDATES` section in `Autounattend.xml`:

```xml
<!-- WITHOUT WINDOWS UPDATES -->
<SynchronousCommand wcm:action="add">
    <CommandLine>cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -File a:\openssh.ps1 -AutoStart</CommandLine>
    <Description>Install OpenSSH</Description>
    <Order>99</Order>
    <RequiresUserInput>true</RequiresUserInput>
</SynchronousCommand>
<!-- END WITHOUT WINDOWS UPDATES -->
<!-- WITH WINDOWS UPDATES -->
<!--
<SynchronousCommand wcm:action="add">
    <CommandLine>cmd.exe /c a:\microsoft-updates.bat</CommandLine>
    <Order>98</Order>
    <Description>Enable Microsoft Updates</Description>
</SynchronousCommand>
<SynchronousCommand wcm:action="add">
    <CommandLine>cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -File a:\openssh.ps1</CommandLine>
    <Description>Install OpenSSH</Description>
    <Order>99</Order>
    <RequiresUserInput>true</RequiresUserInput>
</SynchronousCommand>
<SynchronousCommand wcm:action="add">
    <CommandLine>cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -File a:\win-updates.ps1</CommandLine>
    <Description>Install Windows Updates</Description>
    <Order>100</Order>
    <RequiresUserInput>true</RequiresUserInput>
</SynchronousCommand>
-->
<!-- END WITH WINDOWS UPDATES -->
```

Doing so will give you hours back in your day, which is a good thing.

### Windows 7 support

Windows 7 is going out of support in January 2020, and the scripts for building Windows 7 machines are only
sporadically maintained.

Windows 7 was first released in 2009. This means there are a lot of updates available for Windows 7,
and running Windows Updates on a Windows 7 box using the mechanism described above takes an extremely long time.

The Windows 7 templates therefore take a slightly different approach, first installing Service Pack 1,
updating the servicing stack and then installing the latest update rollup, .NET 4.8 and PowerShell 5.1.
Finally, any missing updates are installed using Ansible.

This means you'll need to install Ansible on your machine if you want to run the Windows 7 scripts.
You can [install ansible on a Linux machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

If you want to run these scripts on a Windows machine, you can try to run Ansible in cygwin or Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.
Alternatively, you can disable the `ansible` steps in the `windows_7.json` file. Make sure to manually run
Windows Update if you do!

### WinRM

These boxes use WinRM. There is no OpenSSH installed.

### Hyper-V Support

If you are running Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 or later, then you can also use these packerfiles to build
a Hyper-V virtual machine. I have the ISO already downloaded to save time, and
only have Hyper-V installed on my laptop, so I run:

```
packer build --only hyperv-iso -var 'hyperv_switchname=Ethernet' -var 'iso_url=./server2016.iso' .\windows_2016_docker.json
```

Where `Ethernet` is the name of my default Hyper-V Virtual Switch. You then can use this box with Vagrant to spin up a Hyper-V VM.

#### Generation 2 VMs

Some of these images use Hyper-V "Generation 2" VMs to enable the latest features and faster booting. However, an extra manual step is needed to put the needed files into ISOs because Gen2 VMs don't support virtual floppy disks.

* `windows_server_insider.json`
* `windows_server_insider_docker.json`
* `windows_10_insider.json`

Before running `packer build`, be sure to run `./make_unattend_iso.ps1` first. Otherwise the build will fail on a missing ISO file

```none
hyperv-iso output will be in this color.

1 error(s) occurred:

* Secondary Dvd image does not exist: CreateFile ./iso/windows_server_insider_unattend.iso: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

### KVM/qemu support

If you are using Linux and have KVM/qemu configured, you can use these packerfiles to build a KVM virtual machine.
To build a KVM/qemu box, first make sure:

* You are a member of the kvm group on your machine. You can list the groups you are member of by running `groups`. It should
  include the `kvm` group. If you're not a member, run `sudo usermod -aG kvm $(whoami)` to add yourself.
* You have downloaded [the iso image with the Windows drivers for paravirtualized KVM/qemu hardware](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso).
  You can do this from the command line: `wget -nv -nc https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso -O virtio-win.iso`.

You can use the following sample command to build a KVM/qemu box:

```
packer build --only=qemu --var virtio_win_iso=./virtio-win.iso ./windows_2019_docker.json
```

### Parallels support

In case you're using Parallels, you can now build the `Windows Server 2019 with Docker` VM.

Prerequisites:
* Parallels Pro or Business, version 11 and up.
* Vagrant Parallels Provider: https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels

You can use the following sample command to build a Parallels VM:

```
packer build --only=parallels-iso windows_2019_docker.json
```


The Parallels builder config turns `efi boot` off in order to use the same answer file like all the other builders. If you find you need to turn `efi boot` on then make sure to adjust the appropriate answer file, especially the section regarding the partitioning of the disk.
If you need to further customize the VM, consult the documentation at https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/parallels-iso.html. 

### Using .box Files With Vagrant

The generated box files include a Vagrantfile template that is suitable for use
with Vagrant 1.7.4+, but the latest version is always recommended.

Example Steps for Hyper-V:

```
vagrant box add windows_2016_docker windows_2016_docker_hyperv.box
vagrant init windows_2016_docker
vagrant up --provider hyperv
```
